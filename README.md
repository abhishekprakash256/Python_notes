# Programming Notes

This repository contains mixed notes on various programming languages and tools for a quick recap. These notes cover fundamental concepts, common syntax, and practical tips for several programming languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, Terraform, SQL, and more.

Whether you're revisiting concepts or looking to brush up on specific tools, this repository serves as a convenient reference guide.

## Languages & Tools Covered

- **Python**: From basic syntax to advanced topics like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), testing, and libraries like pandas, NumPy, and more.
- **JavaScript**: Key features, ES6+ syntax, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous programming.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code (IaC), configuration files, resource management, and cloud infrastructure.
- **SQL**: Database interactions using SQL commands, querying, and SQLite integration in Python.
- **Version Control**: Git commands and workflows for managing source code repositories.
- **Cloud Providers**: Basic configurations for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

## Key Concepts

### Python

- **Data Structures**: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets.
- **Control Flow**: If/else, Loops (for, while), Exception Handling (try/except).
- **Functions**: Defining functions, parameters, and return values.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation.
- **Libraries**: Usage of popular Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `requests`, etc.
- **Testing**: Unit testing with `unittest`, `pytest`.

### JavaScript

- **Variables**: `let`, `const`, and `var` for variable declarations.
- **Functions**: Defining functions, anonymous functions, arrow functions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting elements, modifying content, and event handling.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: `Promises`, `async/await`, and handling asynchronous code.

### Terraform

- **Providers**: Configuring cloud providers (AWS, GCP, etc.) in Terraform.
- **Resources**: Creating and managing resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and more.
- **Variables**: Defining and using variables in configuration files.
- **Outputs**: Displaying results with output blocks.
- **Lifecycle**: Managing resource lifecycle with `create_before_destroy` and `for_each` arguments.
- **State Management**: Securing and managing Terraform state files.

### SQL

- **SQLite**: Installation and usage of SQLite with Python.
- **CRUD Operations**: Basic operations like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- **Joins**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, etc.
- **Aggregates**: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`.
- **Transactions**: Managing database transactions.

- **Experiment**: Each section has code snippets that you can modify and test in your own environment to solidify your understanding.

## Key Highlights

- **Python**: Comprehensive breakdown of essential topics like loops, conditionals, data structures, OOP principles, and libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Terraform**: Detailed explanations on how to configure multi-cloud infrastructure, manage resources, and work with variables and outputs.
- **SQL**: Practical guide to using SQLite with Python, along with examples of CRUD operations, joins, and aggregates.
